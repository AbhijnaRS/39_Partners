
🧠 Vita3D – Gesture-Based Anatomy Explorer
📌 Overview

Vita3D is an interactive 3D anatomy visualization system that allows users to explore human body parts using hand gestures.
The project uses a webcam for input, Mediapipe for gesture recognition, and Three.js for real-time 3D rendering.
This enables a hands-free, immersive learning and exploration experience.

✨ Features

🎥 Webcam-based input – no physical controllers required.

✋ Hand gesture recognition – rotate, zoom, switch, and interact with anatomy models.

🧩 3D anatomy visualization – explore organs like the brain in detail.

🔄 Real-time interaction – immediate response to gestures.

📊 Feedback system – UI updates confirm detected actions.

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

3D Rendering: Three.js

Hand Tracking: Mediapipe Hands

Camera Utilities: Mediapipe Camera Utils

🚀 How It Works

Open the project webpage.

The webcam captures your hand movements.

Mediapipe detects 21 hand landmarks in real time.

Recognized gestures (fist, open palm, swipe, point, etc.) are mapped to actions.

The 3D anatomy model updates instantly based on your gestures.

The system provides feedback on recognized gestures.

Conclusion
Vita3D provides a natural, gesture-based approach to interacting with 3D anatomy.
By combining real-time hand tracking and 3D visualization, it offers an engaging, immersive, and educational experience.
